            <h1>Winter is coming</h1>
            <p>Right now the driving coil is very bad. Southern and western Finland have been predicted
                exceptionally large amounts of snow.<br></p>
            <p>This is quite rare nowadays. Police have appealed to people to keep a remote day if possible. Now
                let's find our skis and go skiing!<br></p>
            <p>Did you know that skiing is the national sport of Finnish?<br></p>
            <p>Like example in Finland children go to ski in school and daycare. Like, where other countries people do
                this? I think this is fabulous<br><br> Now I wish nice, snowy winter days to all.</p>

        <h1>Differences between html and html5</h1>

        <h5>Now i'm going to list some stuff about differences between html and html5: </h5>

        Html5 is more secure than html, because there is no need for HTTP cookies. Html5 also includes new elements like
        video and there is lesser need for plug-ins.<br>
        Html5 has a maximum support for mobile devices.<br>

        <video src="img/skull.mp4" controls width="400" height="250">
            <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
                Here is a <a href="img/skull.mp4">link to the video</a></p>
